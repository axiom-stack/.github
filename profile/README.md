# Axiom Infra

**Infrastructure for AI reasoning under strict data constraints.**

Axiom enables cloud-grade AI reasoning on sensitive data **without the data ever leaving its boundary**.

We separate **reasoning structure** from **data identity**, allowing modern language models to operate on safe, identity-free representations while preserving semantic meaning.

---

## Why Axiom Exists

Many high-value AI workflows are blocked today.

Not because models are weak, but because:
- sensitive data cannot move
- redaction destroys reasoning
- encryption blocks inference
- on-prem models cap quality and velocity

Axiom is built for environments where **data movement is not allowed**, but **high-quality reasoning is still required**.

---

## Our Approach

Axiom introduces a **semantic boundary**:

- Sensitive data stays local
- Identity is removed deterministically
- Relationships, roles, and structure are preserved
- Only safe, structured reasoning context reaches the model

This makes cloud LLMs usable in regulated and high-trust environments **without sacrificing reasoning quality**.

---

## Design Principles

- **Correctness over hype**  
- **Determinism over heuristics**  
- **Explicit boundaries over implicit trust**  
- **Auditable abstractions over opaque filtering**

We treat failure modes as first-class concerns and design systems that fail safely.

---

## What We Are Building Toward

Axiom is not a compliance tool.

It is infrastructure that allows intelligence to exist **where data cannot move**, unlocking AI reasoning in workflows that were previously off-limits.

## Status

Early-stage infrastructure project.  
Focused on correctness, evaluation, and narrow real-world validation.

## License

License will be determined as the project matures.
